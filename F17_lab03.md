+a. This is a binary clock, which displays the current time in base 2 represented by colored blocks.

+b. As a user, I can open the Help menu so that I can view the instructions about how to read the binary clock. As a user, I can open one of the color menus so that I can change the color of the background or the on/off block. As a user, I can open the Screen Settings menu so that I can maximize of minimize the size of the blocks against the background.

+c. The software does run. Right now, it only displays a bunch of flashing blocks that represent the time in binary. There are options to change the coloring or to pull up the instructions.

+d. Instead of having an am/pm column, there could be an additional option to display the clock as a 24 hour clock in binary. Add the option to make some noise notification on the hour. Add an alarm that will go off at the exact second it is set to.

+e.
