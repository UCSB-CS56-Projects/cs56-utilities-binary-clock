+ a. This is a binary clock, which displays the current time in base 2 represented by colored blocks.

+ b. As a user, I can open the Help menu so that I can view the instructions about how to read the binary clock. As a user, I can open one of the color menus so that I can change the color of the background or the on/off block. As a user, I can open the Screen Settings menu so that I can maximize of minimize the size of the blocks against the background.

+ c. The software does run. Right now, it only displays a bunch of flashing blocks that represent the time in binary. There are options to change the coloring or to pull up the instructions.

+ d. Instead of having an am/pm column, there could be an additional option to display the clock as a 24 hour clock in binary. Add the option to make some noise notification on the hour. Add an alarm that will go off at the exact second it is set to.

+ e. The quality of the README is pretty good. It clearly documents how the code is separated into the different files and how to run the program. To improve it, there could be additional sections describing the different seting options.

+ f. TargetS "jar", "mantisJavadoc", "mantisJws" and  "javadoc" need descriptions. There is no old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed. The build.xml file is clear and organized.

+ g. Yes, there are enough issues that statisfy 1000 points. The issues are very clear about what they want, except the java.lang.StackOverflowError which is intentionally vague.

+ h. We did not find any additional issues.

+ i. There is a Circle class that is not used in any of the classes. Other classes have straightforward TO-DO lists about things to fix/add and comments about  what the class is intended to do. The relationships between classes are documented in the README.md file. In the TimePanel class, some of the code are repetitive and they can be refactored into a loop. For other programmers, I would tell them to look at BinaryClock class first because it is the main class which calls other classes. I would also say the Circle class is not used in any other classes.

+ j. BinaryClock has no test coverage. There are no JUnit tests for any of the methods. There is every opportunity to expand test coverage because there currently is none.
